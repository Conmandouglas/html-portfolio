<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Connor, and I enjoy coding... a lot! It all started year and years ago, when I was a just a little kid
  and I got my first Kano (Which was a rasberry pi that was made for coding) and I learned how to code basic things in Python.
  Since then, as the years have passed, I have only grown, and so have my interests!
</p>

  Before I dive into my whole coding life story, you have to know a little bit about me! I am a teenager that has always enjoyed
  computers and anything related since an early age. I have went from a low budget $250 computer, to what I have now to play
  awesome games with my friends. Yes, video games. I play many games on computer, including sandbox ones such as Minecraft
  or Stardew Valley, as well as online multiplayer titles such as Fortnite and Call of Duty. Never have I played such games
  on a console, always I have been a computer lover. But what did I have before my low budget computer? A little old Kano
  that I got as a young child that was made for kids my age, and you could do Scratch, basic python, and fun games on it.
  I did some python, drawing, and a lot of Scratch that would eventually lead to a small YouTube channel based around it that
  I continued with for a couple years. Then I went from Scratch, to Code Combat, to Python, to Unity, and now to what I am learning
  now, Web Development, and this is the longest I have been committed to any sort of coding. And most importantly, I also lover
  hanging out with my friends! Not only am I on my computer (Which I love... did I say that already??), but I enjoy having fun
  times doing things in real life such as Bowling, Ice Skating, Trampoline Jumping, Snowboarding, and more awesome stuff!

  Now, what you have been waiting for... or dreading as most people probably would.. my life story! This will 100% be summed up, as
  you would not want to hear <i>all too much</i>. As previously inferred, my first computer I recieved was my Kano, in which I had at
  a very young age. For the longest time that is all I had. On it stood a couple basic games including a pixel-based learning code rpg,
  Minecraft rasberry pi (Which was <i>extremely boing</i> by the way), and Scratch. On the more learning side, there was this one
  where you had a pen and you coded using lines of Python to move it to make different art and shapes. Another one was about music, and
  then there was just one where you learned a lot about Python. It was cool, but I knew I could do better, so I asked for a computer and 
  was given a budget of $250 dollars, and oh boy! I spent it to the max and got the best I could get at the time. It went a <i>lot</i> 
  faster than my small linux based rasberry pi kano from pre-2017. I got my usual games that I enjoyed the play as mentioned previously,
  than later on I started to learn all about Scratch. I did the in game tutorials, played Scratch games, and just played around in
  Scratch until I learned it myself. I also had this "20 Games to Create in Scratch" book that helped guide me into making more advanced
  games as Scratch was nowhere near as prominent on Youtube then as it is now. I realized that, created a Youtube channel to help small
  creators, but eventually though, as with all things, I was growing out of Scratch entirely. Something web-based and made for kids can 
  only do so much for you, so I looked up a game engine and low and behold, Unity!

<p>
  This started a new chapter in my coding career. I downloaded and installed Unity, and started with some basic Unity Learn. Then I went
  to Youtube and completed tutorials by creators such as Code Monkey and Game Makers toolkit. Eventually, I would go as far as getting a
  course of two from Udemy, and not completing much at all in either, even if they were quality courses (which they were). So then I took
  a break from coding a lot of things. Then I entered my final phase, the one I am in today. I started the Odin project, went all the way
  up to Flexbox, went to Youtube to understand it more, found an awesome bootcamp 8 hour course by SuperSimpleDev. I completed it, with it
  being the first course I had completed. Then I went to Udemy during one of its sales, and got the course I am working on now, by Dr. Angela
  Yu, an awesome Udemy Instructure.

  In conclusion, my coding journey has been a long and tough spurt of growth and pain. It all started from something small, a small little
  fancy Rasberry Pi, and eventually lead me up to the awesome Web Development Course I am following now, that is guiding me along the great
  journey of web development. Considering what the Unity game engine is going through now, it is such a relief that I stranded away from it
  before it was too late!
