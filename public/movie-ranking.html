<h3>Spiderman Far From Home</h3>
<p>Has some awesome action scenes, a great hero teammup, and an the most ultimate villian teamup of all time. The best superhero movie of all time.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Sense</h3>
<p>A cleverly crafted suspensful horror that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the full length of the movie</p>
<h3>The Marvels</h3>
<p>An awesome new superhero movie where 3 unlikely heros teamup to fight the force of evil in what will hopefully become a classic one day.</p>
